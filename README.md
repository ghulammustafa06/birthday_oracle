# BirthdayOracle! ðŸŽ‰

Heyyy there! ðŸ‘‹

I design a this **BirthdayOracle**, a fun little web app that makes the magical guesswork of figuring out your birthday. No need to spill the beansâ€”we'll guess it for you! Let's dive in and see how close we can get to your special day.

Ever wondered how cool it would be if someone could guess your birthday just by asking a few questions? Well, that's what BirthdayOracle is here for! Answer a series of questions with a simple "Yes" or "No," and watch the magic unfold as we narrow down the exact date of your birthday.
